\section{Key concepts of Human Centered AI } 

\subsection{Observations}

% Comments by Sonja:

% This section describes sensors, but mostly sticking to textual examples
% (NLP). There are thousands of types of sensors, and they all serve their
% purpose depending on what data they sense. This is different for all
% pilots - IoT uses variety of sensors: cameras, ultrasonic, infrared,
% etc.; Robotics use potentiometers, accelerometers, Gimbles etc.; Media
% uses cameras.... Perhaps the examples for sensors in this section can be
% specific for each pilot (maybe even include this section in each
% pilot).

% What is the meaning of "sensor of a "text classifier""?  

% Sensor is something that gives information - if this here also stores
% a file, than that is a transducer - does something.

An agent can observe the humans and the environment through its
sensors. Here we mean sensor in a broad sense, i.e., everything that
can be used by the artificial intelligent agent to autonomously
acquire data about the environment (including the humans) and
everything the humans and the environment can use to input data to the
artificial intelligent agent.  Observations are collected via
sensors. There are thousands of types of sensors, and they all serve
their purpose depending on what part of the environment they
sense. Every single pilot in the project has defined a different set
of sensors. E.g., IoT sensors are: cameras, ultrasonic, infrared,
\dots; Robotics sensors are: potentiometers, accelerometers, Gimbles
\dots.; Media sensors include: digital cameras, audio recording,
textual documents, etc.  Essentially, sensor systems are those that
inject input data. Input data can be represented in many different
ways, they can be continuous discrete, structured, lists, trees,
etc. Typically, input data is provided with some meta information that
describes its structure.  Examples of input data are video, picture,
all type of sensors, texts, spoken sentences, etc. In online system,
input data are streams of data, not just a batch of data. Among the
observations we also include the ``commands/requests'' that the human
poses to the artificial agent.  For this reason, one can think that in
general every data is associated with some time stamp $t$ (that can be
relative or absolute). In some cases time information is not relevant
for the decision process of the agent, in other it is. However, what
it should always hold is that agents can take a decision at time $t$
only on the basis of the data that are available to the agent before
this time, i.e., data that are tagged with the timestamp $t'< t$.

Data can be associated with a type and a structure, which should
also be provided as input. 

\begin{definition}
The \emph{observations} of an AI agent are all the data that an agent
can observe at any possible point of its evolution.
\todo{data and attributes such as the type}
\todo{point of its evolution vs. instant of its execution}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Actions}
\def\actions{\mathcal{A}} Here we consider actions in the very broad
sense as all the possible outcomes of an intelligent system. They can
be physical actions, e.g., the robot is moving 10 cm forward, an
autonomous car braking, an autonomous personal assistant books a room
in hotel Bellavista, or buys 100 stocks of the company SuperGulp.
Actions include also \emph{planning actions}, i.e.  some plan (e.g.,
sequence of simpler actions, or more complex structure of actions) the
agent intends to execute form now on. Another type of action are
\emph{informative actions} that inform the human of a certain
conclusion that the agent has reached. Examples of informative actions
are classifications of input, ranking, predictions done by some
regression model, etc.

In the abstract, any artificial agent can be associated with a set of
actions $\actions$ that it can take. For instance, the set of actions
for a classifier with classes $C_1,\dots,C_n$, is the set
$\{C_1,\dots,C_n\}$ of possible outcome of the classifier. If the
classifier is a multi-classifier, then the set of actions is the set
of all the subsets of $\{C_1,\dots,C_n\}$. If the system is a ranking
system, then its set of actions is the set of ranking functions
of a class of documents provided in input.
The actions associated to a planner that works on a particular
planning domain $\left<S,A,T,s_0,G\right>$ is the set of plans $\pi$
that reaches the goal $G$. The set of actions of a robot that can
navigate a room can be $\{forward(x),turn(\theta) \mid x \in R^+,
\theta \in [-\pi,\pi]\}$.
As one can see from the above example the set of actions associated to
an artificial agent can be discrete or continuous and they strictly
depend from the input.

Notice that in the set of Actions we don't consider the actions
executed by the environment or by the human. As we explained before,
they are part of the Observations.

An important aspect of the actions in human centered AI is that they
should be relevant for the human. For instance in a ranking system,
the user might be interested only in the first 10 documents. In this
case, though the outcome of the system is an entire ranking of all the
documents, the actions which are relevant for the human are only the
first 10 documents in each rank. Another example with physical robots
is the following: the outcome of the planner of a robot could be to
move from the kitchen to the bedroom following one particular path
(path planning) though the human could be interested only in the
starting and ending point of the path, and not in the precise
trajectory that is followed by the robot. Some outcomes of a robot
could also not be perceivable by a human. E.g., the fact that the
personal assistance books the hotel BellaVista through Trivago or
Booking.com is not perceived by the user, which only gets the booking
information as outcome.

\begin{definition}
  The set of actions of an artificial intelligent agent is a set
  $\actions$ which includes all the possible outcomes of the 
  agent that are perceivable and have relevant effects on the human and the
  environment in which the agent operate.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Explanations} 
An explanation is an argument that a human can understand and can
accept. To be understandable the explanation should be given in a
``language'' which is understandable by the human. Furthermore, the
explanation contains an argumentation, (e.g., a sequence of facts and
rules that derives facts from previous facts in the sequence) that
justifies a the conclusion of the artificial agent starting from the
given input. This argument can be a deductive or an inductive
argument. However what is most important is that the human should be
able to decide to accept or not accept such an argument.

In general an explanation of a decision taken by the agent can be
independent from how the agent reaches such a decision. This is
especially true when the decision is taken by a black-box method such
as a neural network. 

A deductive argument is an argument in which it is thought that the
premises provide a guarantee of the truth of the conclusion. In a
deductive argument, the premises are intended to provide support for
the conclusion that is so strong that, if the premises are true, it
would be impossible for the conclusion to be false.

An inductive argument is an argument in which it is thought that the
premises provide reasons supporting the probable truth of the
conclusion. In an inductive argument, the premises are intended only
to be so strong that, if they are true, then it is unlikely that the
conclusion is false.

In other words in order to define explanation we need to have a
language $L$ and a combination of deductive/inductive $DIS$ system
that are accepted by the human. Within a deductive/inductive system
$DIS$ it is possible to define a set $\Pi$, that called valid
deductions, such that each $\pi$ is a deduction of a decision $A$ from
a set of input data $O$, which is acceptable by the human.

\begin{definition}[Explanation]
  The explanation of a decision/action $A$ of an artificial
  intelligent agent as a reaction of the observations 
  $O$, is an argument in the deductive/inductive system $DIS$
  of the fact that $A$ follows from $O$, i.e., it is a proof $\pi$ of
  $O\models_{DIS} A$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Requirements}
A requirement, including the concept of dependability requirement, is the formulation of a functional need that an  artificially intelligent
system must satisfy. This is central to the problem of verifiable AI, which has the
objective of checking that the systems meets its
requirements, including the functional specification and the dependability attributes. 
Dependability requirements are expressed in a human understandable
way, they are indeed formulated by humans. Then the problem of
verifiable AI, is how to translate these requirements in algorithms
that check that the system is compliant with them. 
Being a human produced artifact, providing a sharp definition of
(dependability) requirement is rather complex if not impossible. In
the examples provided in this overview document (e.g., automotive and
medical domain) dependability requirements can be classified into two
categories 
\begin{description}
\item[Input-output constraints for inference:] given a certain (class of) input data
  a specific (class of) output data is required. If input and output
  data classes are described in some logical term then this type of
  requirement can be seen as pairs: 
$$
\Delta\vdash\Gamma 
$$
where $\Delta=\{\delta_1,\dots,\delta_m\}$ is a set of properties of
the input, and $\Gamma=\{\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n\}$ is a set of
properties of the expected output. Intuitively $ \Delta\vdash\Gamma $
means that ``if the input meets all the properties in $\Delta$, then
the output should meet at least one property in $\Gamma$.''.  This
input output constraint on inference can also be associated with some
level of satisfiability. E.g., the constraint $\Gamma\vdash\Delta$
should be satisfied at least 99\% of the time.

\item[Input-output constraints for learning:] one of the main
  characteristics of AI systems is that their behaviour is determined
  by the data that are used to train the system. Examples of
  requirement in this sense is the fact that the training data are
  representative of a given population for which the AI system is
  designed. There is no simple way to express this type of requirement
  in some mathematical structure. This could be the subject of further
  study in the project. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Artificial intelligent models} 
An AI agent takes decisions on how to act in the environment or how to
react to some input given by the humans and/or by the environment, on
the basis of one or more \emph{models} of the surrounding environment
and of the humans it is currently interacting with. Models are
abstract (computational) structures that allow to answer queries about
what holds in the current or in the past situation and to predict what
will be true/false in the future. Models can also be used to simulate
possible evolutions of the humans-environment in order to take the
``right'' decision now.

Artificial intelligent agents are equipped with a set of artificial
intelligence models that represent the knowledge of the agent about
the environment. Such a knowledge is used to support the agent in
making decisions about which action to perform. In general we cannot
assume that such models are \emph{correct}, i.e., that their
predictions are effectively true.  For this reason it is more
appropriate to speak about \emph{belief} instead of knowledge Neither
we can assume that models are \emph{complete} i.e., that they describe
the environment in all it's details. Indeed they are
\emph{simplified/abstract} representations of some aspect of the
environment obtained by abstracting away irrelevant (believe to be
irrelevant) details.
